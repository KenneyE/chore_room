Choreroom (Alpha)
----------

##The problem:
At any given time there are roughly 30 resident students at App Academy. 30 people make a lot of trash and dirty dishes. Everyone is usually happy to help with chores when asked, but since no-one feels any ownership over a specific task, it's easy to pass the buck and hope someone else with take care of the trash, dishes, etc.

##The solution
Enter Choreroom. Each week Choreroom randomly assigns chores to residents. The residents recieve an email informing them of the chore they have been assigned, with a link to follow to mark their task completed once it is done. Choreroom has a main chores page that lists all of the chores, who is assigned to them, and whether they are completed yet, so residents feel some mild social pressure to ensure their chore gets done.

Choreroom was spearheaded by [Matt Petrie](http://www.mattpetrie.io) and [Nathan Hsieh](http://www.nathanhsieh.com), and is intended to live on as an open source collaborative effort for App Academy students.
